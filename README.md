# Portfolio

A modern reconstruction of my original 2022 personal portfolio. This project serves as a "time capsule," upgrading the design and code quality of my early developer days while preserving the original aesthetic.

## 📅 Then vs. Now
* **Original Date:** April 13, 2022
* **The Tech:** HTML/CSS (Classic layout)
* **The Focus:** Python development and Discord bots (`discord.py`)

## ✨ Modern Upgrades
- [x] **Responsive Design:** Now works on mobile devices (the 2022 version was desktop-only).
- [x] **CSS Variables:** Using `:root` for easier theme management.
- [x] **Semantic HTML:** Better accessibility and SEO structure.
- [x] **Clean UI:** Refined typography and spacing while keeping the signature "Dark Slate & Gold" theme.

## 🛠️ Built With
* **HTML5** - Markup structure
* **CSS3** - Flexbox & Custom Properties
